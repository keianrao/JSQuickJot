A small browser JS app containing a text box and a drawing canvas. Meant for jotting things down while thinking, without pen and paper.

This is one of the few things where there isn't a straightforward desktop alternative.

![Screenshot. Two main interactive elements arranged vertically, a 'Text notes' with some point-form notes inside of it, and a scrollable 'Drawing area' with a crude drawing of two points with an arrow between them. At the bottom are some warnings, "Caution! Reloading the page will clear the canvas. Attempting to draw text or anything elaborate is not recommended."](Screenshot.gif)
